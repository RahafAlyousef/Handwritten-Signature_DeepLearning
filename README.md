# Handwritten-Signature_DeepLearning
The fifth and last project of the Data Science Bootcamp T5 is called Handwritten Signature Forgery Detection Using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

# Abstract:
Handwritten signatures are very important in our social and legal life for verification and authentication.
A signature can be accepted only if it is from the intended person. The probability of two signatures made by the same person being the same is very less. Many properties of the signature may vary even when two signatures are made by the same person. So, detecting a forgery becomes a challenging task.
The goal of this project is to detect the forgery signature. Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, Copyright, and Intellectual Property Rights, Regulatory and Government Compliance will benefit from this project.

In our project, a solution based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is presented where the model is trained with a dataset of signatures, and predictions are made as to whether a provided signature is genuine or forged.

# Data Set:
• The Handwritten Signature dataset is found on Kaggle. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset

• The dataset contains the signature of the user both genuine and forged. In the dataset, the directory number says the name of the user and it's classified into two: Geniune and forged.

# Tools:
